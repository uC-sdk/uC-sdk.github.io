{"name":"uC-sdk","tagline":"Lightweight 32-bits micro-controllers SDK. ","body":"### Welcome to uC-sdk\r\nuC-sdk is an SDK that lets you work with 32-bits micro-controllers. It has been designed to be simplistic yet usable with little overhead.\r\n\r\nYou can can grab the source code from github:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/grumpycoders/uC-sdk.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease clone the repository and browse the examples folder. It contains sample projects for several of the boards that it supports.\r\n\r\n### Supported architectures\r\nAt the moment, uC-sdk is only supporting arm embedded 32-bits micro-controllers. As a result, you'll most definitely want to use [an arm toolchain](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded). You'll find it available pre-packaged for Windows, Linux and MacOS. Note that Ubuntu 14.04 natively has [packages available](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/gcc-arm-none-eabi).\r\n\r\n### Noteworthy tools\r\n[OpenOCD](http://openocd.sourceforge.net/) is a great tool to work with the kind of CPUs that uC-sdk supports.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
